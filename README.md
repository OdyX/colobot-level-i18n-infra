# Colobot levels translation infrastructure #

This repository contains work-in-progress for a new translation infrastructure for the [Colobot levels](https://github.com/colobot/colobot-data/tree/master/levels); it is based on the excellent [po4a](http://po4a.alioth.debian.org/) and attempts to get it working with CMake directly.

Please talk to [OdyX](mailto:odyx@debian.org) if you have questions.
